# SongRecommenderSystem
Another interesting use-case of TuriCreate in Machine Learning i.e. Song recommender System.

This repository explores the use of two different recommender systems:
1.Popularity Based Recommendation Systems: As the name suggests, the Popularity Based Recommendation System works on and with the trend. It uses whatever items, in this case songs which are in trend at the moment. If a certain product(song) is being picked more almost everytime by a new user, it means that the likihood of another user picking it is high. Thus we could recommend that particular product to the new user.\
2.Personalised Recommender Systems: These are a different Recommender Systems, quite similar to Content Based Recomendation Systems as they rely on the input data from the new user, based on which different products(i.e. songs) are recommended to him/her.

In this repostory we will be using **_Popularity Based Recommendation Systems_**.
